Dispute Resolution,,,,
,,,,
Auburn's Preferred Language,,,,
"In the event of a dispute between the parties, the parties agree to negotiate a settlement in good faith.  Should this fail to resolve the dispute, the parties shall be free to pursue resolution through mediation where a mutually agreed upon neutral third party assists the disputants in reaching a negotiated settlement but has not the authority to bind either party to any resolution. For any financial claim against Auburn which cannot be resolved through negotiation or mediation, Sponsor's sole option is to file a claim with the Alabama State Board of Adjustment per the Code of the State of Alabama ¤¤41-9-60 through ¤¤41-9-74.",,,,

Common Problems,Why,1st response to Sponsor,2nd response to Sponsor refusal,
Sponsor wants Auburn to agree to binding arbitration,Auburn University is an instrumentality of the State of Alabama and is therefore granted sovereign immunity under the Alabama Constitution and the United States Constitution. Alabama law provides that the exclusive venue for a claim for damages against Auburn is the Alabama State Board of Adjustment,"Remove references to binding dispute resolution, like arbitration. Leave references to non-binding dispute resolution, like mediation.",Remain silent/court of competent jurisdiction,
