Virginia Tech has evaluated the scope of work proposed under this agreement and believes that information resulting from or arising during the performance of this project qualifies as fundamental research, in accordance with National Security Decision Directive 189 and the USD (AT&L) memoranda on Fundamental Research dated May 24, 2010. Virginia Tech does not anticipate that the university will have access to or generate any information that may be sensitive, proprietary, inappropriate for release to the public, or otherwise restricted for national security reasons (e.g. Covered Defense Information). Additionally, there are no known defense articles involved or defense services occurring. Virginia Tech believes this research agreement supports basic/applied research for both military and commercial applications. We respectfully request Contracting Officer written approval to authorize the fundamental research exclusion found within DFARS 252.204-7000 (a)(3) (Oct 2016). This authorization within part (a)(3) of the contract clause would remove the research dissemination controls from the agreement and allows Virginia Tech to perform fundamental research, the results of which are ordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientific community.

Negotiation Position #2 – Clause Removal
This clause is prescribed at DFARS 204.404-70(a), Additional contract clauses, for use in solicitations and contracts when the contractor will have access to or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public. Virginia Tech will be executing Fundamental Research in accordance with National Security Decision Directive 189 and the USD (AT&L) memoranda on Fundamental Research dated May 24, 2010, and will not have access to or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public.  Therefore, it is respectfully requested for this clause to be removed.  Thank you.

Negotiation Position #3 - Public Domain Approval using Clause's (a)(1).  This position would be used only after Negotiation Position #1 and #2 are unsuccessful.  This would require extensive coordination between OESRC and OSP.

This is a solicitation provision (not a contract clause) and it should not be included within the resulting contract.  If terms are included within an RFP that are reviewed at the solicitation phase, the inclusion of this clause documents that there is the potential for the Government to include DFARS 252.204-7012 in a resulting award.  

OESRC Comments:
Solicitation provisions should not be included within resulting contracts.  However, this clause does not cause any issues from OESRC's perspective if it is included within resulting contracts that includes DFARS 252.204-7012. 

OESRC does not require review of this clause as the proposal/solicitation phase. If it is included in a resulting award, OESRC will review it at that time.
