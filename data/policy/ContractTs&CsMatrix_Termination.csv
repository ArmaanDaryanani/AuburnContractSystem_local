For a breach of non-payment of support by Sponsor, Auburn is under no obligation to continue work on the Project.  During such non-payment period and/or a termination of this Agreement for a non-payment breach, Auburn is under no obligation to conform to any of the Agreement terms herein, except Section 10 (Confidential Information) and Section 12 (Publicity).

,Common Problems,Why,1st response to Sponsor,2nd response to Sponsor refusal,3rd response to Sponsor refusal
,sponsor will want all the money they paid us back  for any early termination on our side,we would lose money,"we did work prior to the termination, we should be paid for that work","Auburn can agree to paying them back if we are in material breach (we do something unethical rather than say, forgetting to send an invoice on time)",
,sponsor wants us to agree to pay damages/replacement costs on top of paying them back.,we would lose more money,We are an instrumentality of the State of Alabama & and a non-profit and do not agree to pay damages in agreements. Section 93 of AL Constitution prohibits us lending credit of the state.,,
,they want a hard stop date for reimbursements if there is an early termination,"we routinely have non-cancelable commitments such as purchase orders that are not returnable/refundable, grad students who get paid quarterly, etc.","get the language ""non-cancelable commitments"" added","see if equipment or grad students are contemplated on the agreement and if not, you can agree to the language.",
