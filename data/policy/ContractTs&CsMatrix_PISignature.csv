PI Signature,,,,
,,,,
Common Problems,Why,1st response to Sponsor,,
Sponsor will want the PI to sign the agreement as a Party.,Auburn faculty do not have signature authority and cannot be parties to agreements.,change it to acknowledges.  They can sign as read & acknowledged if needed. Any language in the agreement requiring the PI to agree in writing should be edited to specify that the PI will agree or have agreed to follow the terms (not in writing) ,,
