FAR 27.303(e)(1)(ii):  ""There are exceptional circumstances and the agency head determines that restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any subject invention will better promote the policy and objectives of chapter 18 of title 35 of the United States Code.""

IAW FAR 27-303(e)(2), if the reason the Contracting Officer wants to retain title is because of FAR 27.303(e)(1)(ii), they should actually include FAR 52.227-11 instead for contracts with nonprofit organizations and make ""only those modifications necessary to address the exceptional circumstances and shall include in the modified clause greater rights determinations procedures equivalent to those at 52.227-13(b)(2).""","Virginia Tech does not meet the requirements for use of this clause as prescribed in 27.303(e)(1).

(g) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance when, after ten (10) days of written notice Contractor has failed to correct the default. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

(h) Warranty.  As a public educational institution executing research efforts, Virginia Tech will use its best efforts to perform the research set forth within this agreement.   Due to the uncertain nature of research, our standard is the execution of research on a best efforts basis.

,"In addition, the clause states at Paragraph (b):

(b) The Contractor shall comply with the following FAR clauses, incorporated by reference, unless the circumstances do not apply. 

It is suggested that you include the following in a response where an award has included this clause (i.e. FAR 52.213-4).  

It is understood that FAR 52.222-41, Service Contract Labor Standards (May 2014), would not apply.  The research efforts that are provided are considered to be ""Professional Services"" as defined within 29 CFR Part 541, Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Computer and Outside Sales Employees, Subpart D, Professional Employees.  29 CFR 541.301, Learned Professionals, provides the exemption to the Service Contract Labor Standards.   

It is also understood that FAR 52.222-55, Minimum Wages Under Executive Order 13658 would not apply.  This clause is prescribed in FAR 52.213-4(b)((1)(ix) to apply when FAR 52.222-6 or FAR 52.222-41 are included in the contract.  FAR 52.222-6 applies to Construction Contracts and, therefore, it does not apply.  As documented above, FAR 52.222-41 does not apply to the research efforts being executed due to the Learned Professionals exemption at 29 CFR 541.301.  Therefore, it is understood that FAR 52.222-55 does not apply to this award.
