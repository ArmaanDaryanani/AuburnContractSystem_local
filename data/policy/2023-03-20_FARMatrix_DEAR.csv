First Position - Use the Text in the Cell to the Right of this one to request removal.

(b) Title to property. Except as otherwise provided by the Contracting Officer, title to all materials, equipment, supplies, and tangible personal property of every kind and description purchased by the Contractor, for the cost of which the Contractor is entitled to be reimbursed as a direct item of cost under this contract, shall pass directly from the vendor to the Government.

Insist on the inclusion of Alt I.  ","As defined within FAR 17.601, a “Management and operating contract” means an agreement under which the Government contracts for the operation, maintenance, or support, on its behalf, of a Government-owned or -controlled research, development, special production, or testing establishment wholly or principally devoted to one or more major programs of the contracting Federal agency.

DEAR 970.5245-1, Property, is prescribed at DEAR 970.4501-1(a) to be included “…in management and operating contracts.”  Based upon the definition within FAR 17.601, Virginia Tech is not executing a management and operating contract.  Therefore, it is respectfully requested for this clause to be removed.
