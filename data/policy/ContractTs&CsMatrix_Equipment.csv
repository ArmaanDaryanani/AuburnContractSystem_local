Common Problems,Why,1st response to Sponsor,2nd response to Sponsor refusal,
sponsor retains ownership of equipment provided or purchased,Auburn wants it,ask to have it vest with Auburn,this is generally not important to fight (confirm with PI/department,
sponsor has lower capitalization threshold,differs from AU's policies and internal accounting mechanisms,ask to change to $5000k,can be agreed to if confirmed by PI/department,
