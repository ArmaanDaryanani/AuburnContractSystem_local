Some Sponsors require Auburn to bear the cost of signing up with a third party payer in order to receive payment for an agreement,often we are not informed ahead of time about these costs or the payer system is installed after the award is signed,"Add language under Payment Terms such as, ""Under no circumstances shall Auburn be liable for any charges as a result of SPONSOR utilizing a third party invoicing service.""","Ask them how much it will cost and add it as an ""electronic invoice service fee"" to the budget.",the department will have to cover the cost.
,TYPE OF LANGUAGE TO LOOK FOR:,,,
,"""Lockheed Martin utilizes electronic invoicing through Direct Commerce, Inc. (DCI) located on the LM Procure-to-PayPortal and available via http://www.myexostar.com. See below Bill To Statement for additional info.""  ""Bill To Statement: All invoices must be submitted electronically via the DCI e-Invoicing application which is available on the LM Procure-to-Pay Portal at http://www.myexostar.com. The DCI e-Invoicing  application is also the source for invoice and payment status details for all invoices. Failure to match your invoice to the Lockheed Martin Purchase Order will significantly delay payment while buyer and Seller resolve questions. If clarification or adjustment of the purchase order is required, contact the buyer prior to invoicing. Invoice must contain the purchase order number and associate the purchase order line item to the expense.""",,,
